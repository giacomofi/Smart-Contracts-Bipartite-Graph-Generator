# Smart-Contracts-Bipartite-Graph-Generator
This tool aims to provide an efficient parser and smart contracts analyzer that builds a bipartite graph representation of SCs (or Decentralized Applications) through the Abstract Syntax Trees generated with ANTLR4

Currently, MindTheDapp is experimental, and it is under constant improvement.
